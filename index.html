            <p>Hi my name as you know is Alexander Bridson. I'm currently in my first year of the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. Last year (2022-2023) I took the 1 year Design Foundations program. I have always had a passion for art. I wasn't sure how to turn it into a career until last year when I discovered the wonders of graphic design</p>
            
            <p>My personal interests include doodling/sketching, watching tv, hangout with friends, and shopping. I always try and make the most out of my time whether that be in regards to school or my personal life.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I beleive that a healthy balance between school and social life is needed to succeed in life.</p>
                <cite>â€” Alexander Bridson</cite>
